i want to talk about leveraging your skills as a web developer to do things on your own like side projects maybe freelancing stuff like that
i am not saying to not get a job 
because i know the common path to take is to graduate college or boot camp ...
when you feel you're ready is to get a job with a salary and try to clim the ladder from there and that's not a bad idea.


나는 웹 개발자로서 자신의 기술을 활용하여 자신 만의 일을 할 수있는 이야기를 나누고 싶습니다.
나는 직업을 얻지 않는다고 말하지 않는다.


but i am trying to get across in this video is just thinking about doing somethings on your own as well 
or if starting your own business is what you want to opposed to the job 
that's great 

it's completely up to you 
everybody's circumstances are different 
everybody's wants and needs are different 



when people say you know do start your own web development business or freelancing they think of the starving freelancer

사람들이 당신이 자신의 웹 개발 사업을 시작하거나 프리랜서를 시작한다고 말하면 그들은 굶주리는 프리랜서를 생각합니다.

because you're completely you're competing against the poorest countries in the world where people are literally woking for like a dollar an hour 

it seem like a recipe for failure and you often hear the term race to the bottom

but there can be success with site like upwork

and i know a lot of people disagree with me but i am telling you this from experience 
i am not just pulling it out of my ass 

 i worked for peanuts at first
 but i looked at it as kind of like an internship or something like that where you are not making money you want and you feel you deseve
 but you are getting that expreience you are getting that experience with clients and just that general having your own business and in running your own operation type of experience which is very valuable 

then once you rack up really good ratings
and reviews then people will start to pay more for your service
